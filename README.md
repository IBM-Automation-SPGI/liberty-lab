#Introduction to Labs

Follow this guide to complete the Hands-on Labs for Liberty

In order to complete all labs, different environmnets have been provisioned. Each environemnt is independent from on another, but we suggest the following order:

## 1. Liberty Introduction

Liberty Workshop environment - VMWare

## 2. Liberty Collectives

Enterprise-Deployment-Liberty-Environment

## 3. Liberty on Containers

This labs will introduce you first to Contaneirs and then to OpenShfit, to finally guide you on how to deploy Liberty on and OpenShift cluster.

**131-Intro-Containers** and **132-Intro-OpenShift** are optional if you are already familiar using podman cli to manage containers and using OpenShift

**133-Liberty-on-OpenShift**
Liberty Container Deployment with CP4Apps on OpenShift

## 4. Liberty InstantOn

This lab will rely on two different environments. The one from the previous Lab and a shared OpenShift Cluster due to version dependencies
