#Introduction to Labs

Follow this guide to complete the Hands-on Labs for Liberty

In order to complete all labs, different environmnets have been provisioned. Each environemnt is independent from on another, but we suggest the following order:

## 1. Liberty Introduction

Liberty Workshop environment - VMWare

## 2. Liberty Collectives

Enterprise-Deployment-Liberty-Environment

## 3. Liberty on Containers

Liberty Container Deployment with CP4Apps on OpenShift

## 4. Liberty InstantOn

This lab will rely on two different environments. The one fromthe previous Lab and a shared OpenShift Cluster due to version dependencies
